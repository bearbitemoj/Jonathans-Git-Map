When we look at the diagram (and when we run the method) 
we see that at 2500 entries the approximate value for collision
is 0,95 equal to 95 % chance that a collision will occur.

The collsion chance will pass 0,5 = 50 % at arround
1200 entries.
The reason that it doesnt need 500 0000 inputs is because
already at around 3000 input according to the graph we can see
that the possibility of a collision are already at 0,96
and at around 4000 inputs collision is standard procedure.
